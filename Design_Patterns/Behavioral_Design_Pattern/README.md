- Chain of Responsibility

  - In object-oriented design, the chain-of-responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern consisting of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects.

- Command

  - behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.

- Interpreter

  - Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

  - "(13+4)-(12+1)"

- Iterator

  - an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet

- Mediator (તટસ્થ વ્યક્તિ)

  - Mediator design pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines an object that centralizes communication between other objects, avoiding direct connections between them.

- Mementor

  - The Memento design pattern is a behavioral pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.

- Observer

  - Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.

  - Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically. Observer pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.

- State

  - The main idea of State pattern is to allow the object for changing its behavior without changing its class.

- Strategy
