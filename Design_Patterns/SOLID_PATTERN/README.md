- SOLID PATTERN DESIGN

    - Single Responsibility Principle

        - The idea behind the SRP is that every class, module, or function in a program should have one responsibility/purpose in a program. As a commonly used definition, "every class should have only one reason to change".

    - open close principle

        - software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification

    - Liskov Substitution Principle

        - Because Square is a type of Rectangle , it should be able to replace Rectangle objects without causing any issues.

        - if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program

    - Interface Segregation Principle

        - a client should not be exposed to methods it doesn't need

    - Dependency Inversion Principle

        - high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions
