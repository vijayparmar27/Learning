- what type of nosql database ?

  - Document-oriented databases (e.g., MongoDB):

    - Scenario: When your data is semi-structured or hierarchical, and you want to store it in a flexible, JSON-like format.
    - Use cases: Content management systems, blogging platforms, e-commerce applications, and any application where the data has a nested or document-like structure.

  - Key-value stores (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB):

    - Scenario: When you need fast and simple key-based data access.
    - Use cases: Caching systems, real-time analytics, session storage, and scenarios where quick retrieval of data by a unique identifier (key) is crucial.

  - Column-family stores (e.g., Apache Cassandra, HBase):

    - Scenario: When you need to scale horizontally and handle large amounts of data with high write and read throughput.
    - Use cases: Time-series data, event logging, recommendation engines, and applications requiring distributed and scalable data storage.

  - Graph databases (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune):

    - Scenario: When relationships between data points are critical, and the data has a graph-like structure.
    - Use cases: Social networks, fraud detection, recommendation engines, and any application where understanding and querying relationships are essential.

  - Object-oriented databases (e.g., db4o, ObjectDB):

    - Scenario: When your application's data model is inherently object-oriented.
    - Use cases: Applications developed with object-oriented programming languages, where the data can be naturally represented as objects.
